### Approach and Process
__What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?__
* I spent too much time on just recapping and watching tutorial videos rather than doing actual work on the project. Will keep that timing in check for future projects.

__What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?__
* Pre Project exercise helped in visualisation, will do more extensive ERD and wireframing in future for better planning

### Code and Code Design
__What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?__
* MVC was used but was not appropriately segmented into different files for each function. Will lean towards the best practice in future.
* Severe lack of commenting, possibly due to the repeated adding and removing of code to see what fits.
* Did not commit repo as often as should have and failed to use git branching practice
* Improper naming conventions, will try to be more consistent in future

__What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?__
* Once I gain more experience on properly using async and await, will definitely use it more often next time.

### WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem

__What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?__
* Tried using the pomodoro technique to enhance productivity

__What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?__
* Lots of time that could have been spent on project work was instead wasted on naps and resting, definitely need to work on bad procrastination habits.

__How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)__
* Overall, unit 2 was much more challenging than the first, a lot of concepts such as AJAX that I still practice and understanding in.
* Course materials could be improved upon with answer guides for pairing exercises and morning exercises so as to allow for better revision after class
